//Notes:
// Why did we use log?
// The problem may involve very large numbers like A = 10^7 and B = 10^12,
// so A^B could be as large as 10^(7 * 10^12), which is far beyond the range of any data type.
//
// Since we cannot compute A^B directly, we use logarithms to compare:
// A^B > C^D <=> B * log(A) > D * log(C)
//
// This works because logarithms turn huge exponents into manageable values.
// The log function returns a double, so we store the results in variables of type double.
