//Notes:
/*
Test Case Understanding (Reverse Thinking):
Suppose:
P = 80  → price after discount
A = 100 → actual/original price

We want to find X → the discount percentage

Cross Multiplication:
If:
     % paid (x)     :     discounted price (P)
          x         :            80
        100         :           100

Then:
    x = (80 * 100) / 100 = 80
    Discount = 100 - 80 = 20%   //we already know from the test case that X=20%, but this method made it easier.
